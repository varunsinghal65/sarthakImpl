The code in this repo basically cover the following behaviour :


If you have 5 checkboxes and 5 select boxes .

User selects #1 checkbox and #2 checkbox and #3checkbox then #1,#2,#3 select boxes should get active rest should be disabled

and as user selects an option from one select box, the option is no longer displayed in the other select tags.

After the user has selected the checkboxes, the select tag should be populated with number of checkboxes selected .
for e.g if user chose 3 checkboxes then 3 select tags should be active and should be populated with 1,2,3 .

ThankYou.
